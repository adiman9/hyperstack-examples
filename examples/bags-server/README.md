# Bags Server Example

This example demonstrates how to run a HyperStack server for Bags fees v2.

## Running

```bash
cargo run
```

The server will start on `[::]:8879` and stream Bags claim entities.

This example reads `.env` from this directory for Yellowstone settings.

## Stack

This server uses the bags-fees-v2 stack from `../../stacks/bags`.
